# Python-FP
Functional Programming in Python

## Getting started
Create a project folder on your local machine, if you haven't done so already. 
Clone this repository, create a virtual environment and install required packages.
```bash
$ mkdir python-fp
$ cd python-fp
$ virtualenv .env
(.env) $ source .env/bin/activate
(.env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, we need to start the jupyter notebook kernel, which will open your default web browser in the current directory and you will be able to interact with the nootebooks.
```bash
$ (.env) $ jupyter notebook
```

## What this repo covers
The exapmles and content within this repository aims to introduce beginner to intermediate level python programmers to the concepts of functional programming. Although python is not a functinoal programming language, you can still take a more functional approach to writing your code which will make it easier to maintain, and be interesting to leant at the same time.

Topics covered:
* OOP vs FP
* lambda expressions vs list comprehensions
* filter, map, reduce
* FP best practices
