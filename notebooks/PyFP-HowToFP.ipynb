    "From Pythons official website, a guide on how to be more functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original source:\n",
    "* https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/functional.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preface\n",
    "I will attempt to take the notes form the above source and implement them in a jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, we’ll take a tour of Python’s features suitable for implementing programs in a functional style. After an introduction to the concepts of functional programming, we’ll look at language features such as iterators and generators and relevant library modules such as itertools and functools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explains the basic concept of functional programming; if you’re just interested in learning about Python language features, skip to the next section on Iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages support decomposing problems in several different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most programming languages are procedural: programs are lists of instructions that tell the computer what to do with the program’s input. C, Pascal, and even Unix shells are procedural languages.\n",
    "* In declarative languages, you write a specification that describes the problem to be solved, and the language implementation figures out how to perform the computation efficiently. SQL is the declarative language you’re most likely to be familiar with; a SQL query describes the data set you want to retrieve, and the SQL engine decides whether to scan tables or use indexes, which subclauses should be performed first, etc.\n",
    "* Object-oriented programs manipulate collections of objects. Objects have internal state and support methods that query or modify this internal state in some way. Smalltalk and Java are object-oriented languages. C++ and Python are languages that support object-oriented programming, but don’t force the use of object-oriented features.\n",
    "* Functional programming decomposes a problem into a set of functions. Ideally, functions only take inputs and produce outputs, and don’t have any internal state that affects the output produced for a given input. Well-known functional languages include the ML family (Standard ML, OCaml, and other variants) and Haskell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The designers of some computer languages choose to emphasize one particular approach to programming. This often makes it difficult to write programs that use a different approach. Other languages are multi-paradigm languages that support several different approaches. Lisp, C++, and Python are multi-paradigm; you can write programs or libraries that are largely procedural, object-oriented, or functional in all of these languages. In a large program, different sections might be written using different approaches; the GUI might be object-oriented while the processing logic is procedural or functional, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a functional program, input flows through a set of functions. Each function operates on its input and produces some output. Functional style discourages functions with side effects that modify internal state or make other changes that aren’t visible in the function’s return value. Functions that have no side effects at all are called purely functional. Avoiding side effects means not using data structures that get updated as a program runs; every function’s output must only depend on its input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages are very strict about purity and don’t even have assignment statements such as a=3 or c = a + b, but it’s difficult to avoid all side effects. Printing to the screen or writing to a disk file are side effects, for example. For example, in Python a call to the print() or time.sleep() function both return no useful value; they’re only called for their side effects of sending some text to the screen or pausing execution for a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programs written in functional style usually won’t go to the extreme of avoiding all I/O or all assignments; instead, they’ll provide a functional-appearing interface but will use non-functional features internally. For example, the implementation of a function will still use assignments to local variables, but won’t modify global variables or have other side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming can be considered the opposite of object-oriented programming. Objects are little capsules containing some internal state along with a collection of method calls that let you modify this state, and programs consist of making the right set of state changes. Functional programming wants to avoid state changes as much as possible and works with data flowing between functions. In Python you might combine the two approaches by writing functions that take and return instances representing objects in your application (e-mail messages, transactions, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional design may seem like an odd constraint to work under. Why should you avoid objects and side effects? There are theoretical and practical advantages to the functional style:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Formal provability.\n",
    "* Modularity.\n",
    "* Composability.\n",
    "* Ease of debugging and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formal provability\n",
    "A theoretical benefit is that it’s easier to construct a mathematical proof that a functional program is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a long time researchers have been interested in finding ways to mathematically prove programs correct. This is different from testing a program on numerous inputs and concluding that its output is usually correct, or reading a program’s source code and concluding that the code looks right; the goal is instead a rigorous proof that a program produces the right result for all possible inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique used to prove programs correct is to write down invariants, properties of the input data and of the program’s variables that are always true. For each line of code, you then show that if invariants X and Y are true before the line is executed, the slightly different invariants X’ and Y’ are true after the line is executed. This continues until you reach the end of the program, at which point the invariants should match the desired conditions on the program’s output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming’s avoidance of assignments arose because assignments are difficult to handle with this technique; assignments can break invariants that were true before the assignment without producing any new invariants that can be propagated onward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, proving programs correct is largely impractical and not relevant to Python software. Even trivial programs require proofs that are several pages long; the proof of correctness for a moderately complicated program would be enormous, and few or none of the programs you use daily (the Python interpreter, your XML parser, your web browser) could be proven correct. Even if you wrote down or generated a proof, there would then be the question of verifying the proof; maybe there’s an error in it, and you wrongly believe you’ve proved the program correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modularity\n",
    "A more practical benefit of functional programming is that it forces you to break apart your problem into small pieces. Programs are more modular as a result. It’s easier to specify and write a small function that does one thing than a large function that performs a complicated transformation. Small functions are also easier to read and to check for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ease of debugging and testing\n",
    "Testing and debugging a functional-style program is easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is simplified because functions are generally small and clearly specified. When a program doesn’t work, each function is an interface point where you can check that the data are correct. You can look at the intermediate inputs and outputs to quickly isolate the function that’s responsible for a bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is easier because each function is a potential subject for a unit test. Functions don’t depend on system state that needs to be replicated before running a test; instead you only have to synthesize the right input and then check that the output matches expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Composability\n",
    "As you work on a functional-style program, you’ll write a number of functions with varying inputs and outputs. Some of these functions will be unavoidably specialized to a particular application, but others will be useful in a wide variety of programs. For example, a function that takes a directory path and returns all the XML files in the directory, or a function that takes a filename and returns its contents, can be applied to many different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time you’ll form a personal library of utilities. Often you’ll assemble new programs by arranging existing functions in a new configuration and writing a few functions specialized for the current task."

    "# Iterators\n",
    "I’ll start by looking at a Python language feature that’s an important foundation for writing functional-style programs: iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object representing a stream of data; this object returns the data one element at a time. A Python iterator must support a method called `__next__()` that takes no arguments and always returns the next element of the stream. If there are no more elements in the stream, `__next__()` must raise the StopIteration exception. Iterators don’t have to be finite, though; it’s perfectly reasonable to write an iterator that produces an infinite stream of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in `iter()` function takes an arbitrary object and tries to return an iterator that will return the object’s contents or elements, raising TypeError if the object doesn’t support iteration. Several of Python’s built-in data types support iteration, the most common being lists and dictionaries. An object is called iterable if you can get an iterator for it.\n",

A later call to the same function creates a new private namespace and a fresh set of local variables. But, what if the local variables weren’t thrown away on exiting a function? What if you could later resume the function where it left off? This is what generators provide; they can be thought of as resumable functions.\n",

    "# Small functions and the lambda expression\n",
    "When writing functional-style programs, you’ll often need little functions that act as predicates or that combine elements in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there’s a Python built-in or a module function that’s suitable, you don’t need to define a new function at all:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "stripped_lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]\n",
    "existing_files = filter(os.path.exists, file_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the function you need doesn’t exist, you need to write it. One way to write small functions is to use the `lambda` statement. `lambda` takes a number of parameters and an expression combining these parameters, and creates an anonymous function that returns the value of the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "adder = lambda x, y: x+y\n",
    "\n",
    "print_assign = lambda name, value: name + '=' + str(value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to just use the `def` statement and define a function in the usual way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def adder(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_assign(name, value):\n",
    "    return name + '=' + str(value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which alternative is preferable? That’s a style question; my usual course is to avoid using lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for my preference is that `lambda` is quite limited in the functions it can define. The result has to be computable as a single expression, which means you can’t have multiway `if... elif... else` comparisons or `try... except` statements. If you try to do too much in a lambda statement, you’ll end up with an overly complicated expression that’s hard to read. Quick, what’s the following code doing?"
